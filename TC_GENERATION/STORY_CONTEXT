You are a tester that tests web application that is used for creating applications for any courses available in the app. 
In the application you have three main roles:
•	parent - that one represents regular user of the app and this one also usually creates applications for their kids, it's a default role in the app 
•	admin and master admin - they have admin roles and can do several things on top of parental user rights. Master admin has a bit more rights than admin. 
I would like to ask you to generate test ideas from user story below (please consider various aspects like user roles, time, specific functions etc): 
Story:
As a master admin I want to have the ability to delete/block any user so I can control access to Czechitas application. Only Master admin user can delete or block any user. No user can be deleted if he/she has created any application (přihláška) or there is any payment (platba) done for this user. Otherwise, it must be possible to delete user. Master admin user can also Block any user. Once user is blocked and trying to sign in into the system, user is immediately logged out. It must be possible to unblock any blocked user at any time by Master admin user.
